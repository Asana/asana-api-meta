  Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
  information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [Custom
  Fields](/developers/documentation/getting-started/custom-fields) developer
  documentation for more information about how custom fields relate to various
  resources in Asana.

      Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, `enum_options` is only relevant for the `enum` type and defines the set of choices that the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these type-specific custom field definitions.
