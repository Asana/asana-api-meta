  Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
  information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [Custom
  Fields](/developers/documentation/getting-started/custom-fields) developer
  documentation for more information about how custom fields relate to various
  resources in Asana.

      Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, `enum_options` is only relevant for the `enum` type and defines the set of choices that the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these type-specific custom field definitions.
  - name: Get a custom field (text)
    url: get-single-text
  - name: Get a custom field (number)
    url: get-single-number
  - name: Get a custom field (enum)
    url: get-single-enum
  - name: Query for custom fields
    url: query-metadata

actions:

  # Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete

  - name: findById
    class: get-single-enum
    method: GET
    path: "/custom_fields/%s"

        comment: In this case, `enum`
      - name: enum_options

        comment: |
          The possible values for this enum to select from.

      Returns the complete definition of a custom field. In this case, that field is an enum. Note the array of objects for the `enum_objects` parameter. The meaning of the fields on these objects are:
      
      **id:** the unique id of this option. 
      **name**: the display name for this option. 
      **enabled**: whether or not this option is enabled to be selected. (For more information, refer to the [Custom Fields](/developers/documentation/getting-started/custom-fields) guide.)
      **color:** the color (if any) of visual elements associated with this option.
