  Custom Fields store the metadata that is used in order to add user-specified
  information to tasks in Asana. Be sure to reference the [Custom
  Fields](/developers/documentation/getting-started/custom-fields) developer
  documentation for more information about how custom fields relate to various
  resources in Asana.

      Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, `enum_options` is only relevant for the `enum` type and defines the set of choices that the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these type-specific custom field definitions.

      Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no more than 50.

      You can add  enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field-id/enum_options` endpoint.

      **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option.** Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to `false ` with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option-id` endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.

      On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to "trashing" the enum option in the Asana web app within the "Edit Fields" dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.

      Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.

      An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/:custom_field/enum_options/insert` endpoint.

      Creates a new custom field in a workspace. Every custom field is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this workspace cannot be changed once set.

      A custom field’s `name` must be unique within a workspace and not conflict with names of existing task properties such as 'Due Date' or 'Assignee'. A custom field’s `type` must be one of  'text', 'enum', or 'number'.

      Returns the full record of the newly created custom field.

      A specific, existing custom field can be updated by making a PUT request on the URL for that custom field. Only the fields provided in the `data` block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged

      When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since you last retrieved the custom field.

      A custom field’s `type` cannot be updated.

      An enum custom field’s `enum_options` cannot be updated with this endpoint. Instead see “Work With Enum Options” for information on how to update `enum_options`.

      Returns the complete updated custom field record.

      Creates an enum option and adds it to this custom field’s list of enum options. A custom field can have at most 50 enum options (including disabled options). By default new enum options are inserted at the end of a custom field’s list.
