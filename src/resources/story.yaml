  A _story_ represents an activity associated with an object in the Asana
  system. Stories are generated by the system whenever users take actions such
  as creating or assigning tasks, or moving tasks between projects. _Comments_
  are also a form of user-generated story.

  Stories are a form of history in the system, and as such they are read-only.
  Once generated, it is not possible to modify a story.
