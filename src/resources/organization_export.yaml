  An _organization_export_ object represents a request to export the complete data of an Organization
  in JSON format.

  To export an Organization using this API:

  * Create an `organization_export` [request](#create) and store the id that is returned.\
  * Request the `organization_export` every few minutes, until the `state` field contains 'finished'.\
  * Download the file located at the URL in the `download_url` field.

  Exports can take a long time, from several minutes to a few hours for large Organizations.

  **Note:** These endpoints are only available to [Service Accounts](/guide/help/premium/service-accounts)
  of an [Enterprise](/enterprise) Organization.

      Download this URL to retreive the full export of the organization in JSON format. It will be
      compressed in a gzip (.gz) container.
    notes:

        May be null if the export is still in progress or failed. If present, this URL
        may only be valid for 1 hour from the time of retrieval. You should avoid
        persisting this URL somewhere and rather refresh on demand to ensure you
        do not keep stale URLs.

      This method creates a request to export an Organization. Asana will complete the export at some
      point after you create the request.
