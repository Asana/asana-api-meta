comment: |
  The _task_ is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are
  centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the middle pane
  according to some view parameters, and the set of selected tasks determines
  the more detailed information presented in the details pane.
notes:
  - |
    A _section_, at its core, is a task whose name ends with the colon character `:`. Sections are unique in that they will
    be included in the `memberships` field of task objects returned in the API when the task is within a section. As
    explained [below](#projects) they can also be used to manipulate the ordering of a task within a project.

    [Queries](#query) return a compact representation of each object which is typically the `id` and `name` fields.
    Interested in a specific set of fields or *all* of the fields?
    Use [field selectors](/developers/documentation/getting-started/input-output-options) to manipulate what data is included in a response.

properties:

  - name: id
    <<: *PropType.Id
    comment: |
      Globally unique ID of the task.

  - name: assignee
    <<: *PropType.User
    comment: |
      User to which this task is assigned, or `null` if the task is
      unassigned.

  - name: assignee_status
    <<: *PropType.AssigneeStatus
    comment: |
      Scheduling status of this task for the user it is assigned to.
      This field can only be set if the `assignee` is non-null.

  - name: created_at
    <<: *PropType.DateTime
    access: Read-only
    comment: |
      The time at which this task was created.

  - name: completed
    <<: *PropType.Bool
    comment: |
      True if the task is currently marked complete, false if not.

  - name: completed_at
    <<: *PropType.DateTime
    access: Read-only
    comment: |
      The time at which this task was completed, or null if the task is incomplete.

  - name: due_on
    <<: *PropType.Date
    comment: |
      Date on which this task is due, or null if the task has no due date. This
      takes a date with YYYY-MM-DD format and should not be used together with
      `due_at`.

  - name: due_at
    <<: *PropType.DateTime
    comment: |
      Date and time on which this task is due, or null if the task has no due
      time. This takes a UTC timestamp and should not be used together with
      `due_on`.

  - name: external
    <<: *PropType.External
    comment: |
      The external field allows you to store app-specific metadata on tasks,
      including an id that can be used to retrieve tasks and a data blob that
      can store app-specific character strings. Note that you will need to
      authenticate with Oauth to access or modify this data. Once an external
      id is set, you can use the notation `external:custom_id` to reference your
      object anywhere in the API where you may use the original object id.
      See the page on Custom External Data for more details.

  - name: projects
    <<: *PropType.ProjectArray
    comment: |
      Array of projects this task is associated with. At task creation time,
      this array can be used to add the task to many projects at once. After
      task creation, these associations can be modified using the `addProject`
      and `removeProject` endpoints.

  - name: parent
    <<: *PropType.Task
    comment: |
      The parent of this task, or `null` if this is not a subtask. This property
      cannot be modified using a PUT request but you can change it with the
      `setParent` endpoint. You can create subtasks by using the subtasks endpoint.

  - name: workspace
    <<: *PropType.Workspace
    comment: |
      The workspace this task is associated with. Once created, task cannot be
      moved to a different workspace. This attribute can only be specified at
      creation time.

  - name: memberships
    <<: *PropType.Memberships
    comment: |
      Array of projects this task is associated with and the section it is in.
      At task creation time, this array can be used to add the task to specific
      sections. After task creation, these associations can be modified using
      the `addProject` and `removeProject` endpoints. Note that over time, more
      types of memberships may be added to this property.

  - name: tags
    <<: *PropType.ObjectArray
    comment: |
      Array of tags associated with this task. This property may be specified on
      creation using just an array of tag IDs. In order to change tags on an
      existing task use `addTag` and `removeTag`.

action_classes:
  - name: Create a task
    url: create
  - name: Get a task

  - name: Update a task
    url: update
  - name: Delete a task
    url: delete
  - name: Query for tasks
    url: query
  - name: Work with subtasks
    url: subtasks
    comment: |
      Creating a subtask is the same as a creating an normal task, but instead of specifying a workspace you must specify a
      parent task. Each task can only have a single parent and you can use the `setParent` endpoint to add or remove a parent from an existing task.

      Created subtasks are added to the end of their parent's list of subtasks.

      You can find all of the subtasks of a task via the `tasks/:ID/subtasks` endpoint.

  - name: Task activity and comments
    url: stories
    comment: |
      Tasks, like some other objects in the system, have a series of <a href="/developers/api-reference/stories">stories</a>
      associated with them. A story can be an indicator of some action taken on a task (such as completing it), or it could be a comment left by a user.

      See the sections on <a href="/developers/api-reference/stories#get-all">querying for all stories</a>
      and <a href="/developers/api-reference/stories#post-comment">commenting on an object</a> for more information.

  - name: Task, project, and section associations
    url: projects
    comment: |
      Each task can be associated with zero or more <a href="/developers/api-reference/projects">projects</a>.

      The `projects` endpoint on a task will return a compact representation of each of the projects on the task specified.

      The `addProject` or `removeProject` endpoints can be used to add and remove projects that a task is a member of by
      providing the required `project` parameter.

      Note that a task may belong to many projects and a single section within each project.

      Requests to add/remove projects, if successful, will return success and an empty data block.

  - name: Tags on tasks
    url: tags
    comment: |
      Each task can be associated with zero or more <a href="/developers/api-reference/tags">tags</a> in the system.
      The API allows you to query and change those associations.

      You can get the list of tags associated with a task by using the `tags` endpoint on a task, which will return a compact
      representation of each of the tags on the task specified.

      You can add or remove a tag using the `addTag` or `removeTag` endpoints, respectively, providing the parameters below.

      Requests to add/remove tags, if successful, will return success and an empty data block.

  - name: Followers on tasks
    url: followers
    comment: |
      Each task can be associated with zero or more followers in the system.

      You can add or remove followers using the `addFollowers` or `removeFollowers` endpoints, respectively, providing the parameters below.

      Requests to add/remove followers, if successful, will return the complete updated task record, described above.

    comment: |
      Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint
      with a data block containing the fields you'd like to set on the task.
      Any unspecified fields will take on default values.

      Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this
      workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set
      explicitly if you specify `projects` or a `parent` task instead.

      `projects` can be a comma separated list of projects, or just a single
      project the task should belong to.

        comment: The task to update.
    comment: |
      A specific, existing task can be updated by making a PUT request on the
      URL for that task. Only the fields provided in the `data` block will be
      updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

      When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
      to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
      you last retrieved the task.

      Returns the complete updated task record.

  - name: delete
    class: delete
    method: DELETE
    path: "/tasks/%s"

        comment: The task to delete.
    comment: |
      A specific, existing task can be deleted by making a DELETE request on the
      URL for that task. Deleted tasks go into the "trash" of the user making
      the delete request. Tasks can be recovered from the trash within a period
      of 30 days; afterward they are completely removed from the system.

      Returns an empty data record.

        notes:
          - |
            A task is considered "modified" if any of its properties change,
            or associations between it and other objects are modified (e.g.
            a task being added to a project). A task is not considered modified
            just because another object it is associated with (e.g. a subtask)
            is modified. Actions that count as modifying the task include
            assigning, renaming, completing, and adding stories.
