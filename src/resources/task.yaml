  The _task_ is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are
  centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the middle pane
  according to some view parameters, and the set of selected tasks determines
  the more detailed information presented in the details pane.

      Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint
      with a data block containing the fields you'd like to set on the task.
      Any unspecified fields will take on default values.

      Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this
      workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set
      explicitly if you specify a project or a parent task instead.
