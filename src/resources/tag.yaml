name: tag
comment: |
  A _tag_ is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. It exists in a
  single workspace or organization.

  Tags have some metadata associated with them, but it is possible that we will
  simplify them in the future so it is not encouraged to rely too heavily on it.
  Unlike projects, tags do not provide any ordering on the tasks they
  are associated with.

# We borrow a bunch of the project templates here because they're literally
# exactly the same

      Updates the properties of a tag. Only the fields provided in the `data`
      block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

      to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
      you last retrieved the task.

      Returns the complete updated tag record.
