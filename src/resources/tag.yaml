name: tag
comment: |
  A _tag_ is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. It exists in a
  single workspace or organization.

  Tags have some metadata associated with them, but it is possible that we will
  simplify them in the future so it is not encouraged to rely too heavily on it.
  Unlike projects, tags do not provide any ordering on the tasks they
  are associated with.

properties:
# We borrow a bunch of the project templates here because they're literally
# exactly the same
  - name: created_at
    <<: *PropType.DateTime
    access: Read-only
    comment: |
      The time at which this tag was created.

  - name: followers
    <<: *PropType.UserArray
    access: Read-only
    comment: |
      Array of users following this tag.

  - name: name
    <<: *PropType.ProjectName
    comment: |
      Name of the tag. This is generally a short sentence fragment that fits
      on a line in the UI for maximum readability. However, it can be longer.

  - name: color
    <<: *PropType.ProjectColor
    comment: |
      Color of the project. Must be either 'null' or one of: 'dark-pink',
      'dark-green', 'dark-blue', 'dark-red', 'dark-teal', 'dark-brown',
      'dark-orange', 'dark-purple', 'dark-warm-gray', 'light-pink', 'light-green',
      'light-blue', 'light-red', 'light-teal', 'light-yellow', 'light-orange',

      The workspace or organization this tag is associated with. Once created,
      tags cannot be moved to a different workspace. This attribute can only
      be specified at creation time.

      Updates the properties of a tag. Only the fields provided in the `data`
      block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

      When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
      to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
      you last retrieved the task.

      Returns the complete updated tag record.
