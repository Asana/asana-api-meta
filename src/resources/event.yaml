comment: |
  An _event_ is an object representing a change to a resource that was observed
  by an event subscription.

  In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to higher
  rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally, change events
  bubble up - listening to events on a project would include when stories are
  added to tasks in the project, even on subtasks.

  Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token.
  The response will be a `412` error - the same as if the sync token had
  expired.

  Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the immediately
  preceding call.

  Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go 'backward' in the history
  by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current sync token
  is generally safe, and will always return the same results.

  When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the
  sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a set
  of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.

  Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner, depending on
  load on the service.

        The resource that triggered the event may be different from the one
        that the events were requested for. For example, a subscription to a
        project will contain events for tasks contained within the project.

          A sync token received from the last request, or none on first sync.
          Events will be returned from the point in time that the sync token
          was generated.

            On your first request, omit the sync token. The response will be the
            same as for an expired sync token, and will include a new valid
            sync token.

            If the sync token is too old (which may happen from time to time)
            the API will return a `412 Precondition Failed` error, and include
            a fresh `sync` token in the response.

      Returns the full record for all events that have occurred since the
      sync token was created.
