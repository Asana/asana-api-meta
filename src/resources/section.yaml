name: section
comment: | 
  A _section_ is a subdivision of a project that groups tasks together. It can
  either be a header above a list of tasks in a list view or a column in a
  board view of a project.

notes:
  - | 
    Sections are largely a shared idiom in Asana's API for both list and board
    views of a project regardless of the project's layout.

    The 'memberships' property when [getting a
    task](/developers/api-reference/tasks#get) will return the information for
    the section or the column under 'section' in the response.

properties:

  - name: id
    <<: *PropType.Id
    comment: |
      Globally unique ID of the section.

  - name: name
    <<: *PropType.SectionName
    comment: |
      The name of the section (i.e. the text displayed as the section header).

  - name: project
    <<: *PropType.Project
    access: Read-only
    comment: |
      The project which contains the section.

  - name: created_at
    <<: *PropType.DateTime
    access: Read-only
    comment: |

    comment: |
      A specific, existing section can be updated by making a PUT request on
      the URL for that project. Only the fields provided in the `data` block
      will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged. (note that
      at this time, the only field that can be updated is the `name` field.)

      When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
      to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
      you last retrieved the task.

      Returns the complete updated section record.

  - name: delete

    method: DELETE
    path: "/sections/%s"

        required: true
        comment: The section to delete.
    comment: |
      A specific, existing section can be deleted by making a DELETE request
      on the URL for that section.

      Note that sections must be empty to be deleted.

      The last remaining section in a board view cannot be deleted.

      Returns an empty data block.

  - name: insertInProject
    class: reorder
    method: POST
    path: "/projects/%s/sections/insert"
    params:
      - name: project

        comment: The section to reorder
      - name: before_section
        <<: *Param.SectionId
        required: false
        example_values:
          - "86420"
        comment: Insert the given section immediately before the section specified by this parameter.
      - name: after_section
        <<: *Param.SectionId
        required: false
        example_values:
          - "86420"
        comment: Insert the given section immediately after the section specified by this parameter.

      Move sections relative to each other in a board view. One of
      `before_section` or `after_section` is required.

      Sections cannot be moved between projects.

      At this point in time, moving sections is not supported in list views, only board views.

      Returns an empty data block.
