name: user_task_list
comment: |
  A _user task list_ represents the tasks assigned to a particular user. It provides API access to a user's "My Tasks" view in Asana.

  A user's "My Tasks" represent all of the tasks assigned to that user. It is
  visually divided into regions based on the task's
  [`assignee_status`](/developers/api-reference/tasks#field-assignee_status)
  for Asana users to triage their tasks based on when they can address them.
  When building an integration it's worth noting that tasks with due dates will
  automatically move through `assignee_status` states as their due dates
  approach; read up on [task
  auto-promotion](/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks#gl-auto-promote) for more
  infomation.

      Returns the compact list of tasks in a user's My Tasks list. The returned
      tasks will be in order within each assignee status group of `Inbox`,
      `Today`, and `Upcoming`.
      
      **Note:** tasks in `Later` have a different ordering in the Asana web app
      than the other assignee status groups; this endpoint will still return
      them in list order in `Later` (differently than they show up in Asana,
      but the same order as in Asana's mobile apps).
      
      **Note:** Access control is enforced for this endpoint as with all Asana
      API endpoints, meaning a user's private tasks will be filtered out if the
      API-authenticated user does not have access to them.
      
      **Note:** Both complete and incomplete tasks are returned by default
      unless they are filtered out (for example, setting `completed_since=now`
      will return only incomplete tasks, which is the default view for "My
      Tasks" in Asana.)
